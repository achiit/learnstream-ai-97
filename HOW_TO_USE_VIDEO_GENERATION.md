   - Example: "explain pythagoras theorem"
3. **Click "Generate Learning Content"**
4. You'll be automatically redirected to the Generate page
5. **Click "Start Assessment & Generate Video"**
6. **Answer 3 quick questions** about your knowledge level
7. **Video generation starts automatically!**

### Method 2: Direct from Generate Page

1. **Go to Generate page** (`/generate`)
2. **Enter your prompt** in the textarea
3. **Click "Start Assessment & Generate Video"**
4. **Answer the 3 assessment questions**
5. **Watch your video generate in the background!**

## ⚙️ Setup Required (First Time Only)

### 1. Environment Variables

Create `.env` file with:
```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
VITE_MANIM_API_URL=http://localhost:5002
```

### 2. Gemini API Key

1. Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy and paste into `.env`

### 3. Manim Server

Make sure your Manim video generation server is running on `http://localhost:5002`

Test it:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5002/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy"}
```

## 💡 Example Usage

### Example 1: Basic Math

**Your Input:** "explain pythagoras theorem"

**Questions Generated:**
1. What is your understanding of triangles?
   - Never heard of them
   - Know basic shapes
   - Understand angles and sides ✓ (you select this)
   - Expert in geometry

2. Have you worked with equations before?
   - No experience
   - Basic algebra ✓
   - Advanced mathematics
   - Professional level

3. How deep should the explanation be?
   - Very basic - ELI5
   - Introductory ✓
   - Detailed with proofs
   - Research level

**AI Analysis:**
- Complexity: 2/5 (Basic-Intermediate)
- Review Cycles: 3
- Enhanced Prompt: "Explain Pythagorean theorem with triangle diagrams, showing how a² + b² = c² works with visual examples..."

**Result:** Video generated in 2 minutes!

### Example 2: Advanced Topic

**Your Input:** "quantum entanglement"

**Questions Generated:**
1. What is your physics background?
2. How familiar are you with quantum mechanics?
3. What's your learning goal?

**AI Analysis:**
- Complexity: 0/5 (Complete beginner)
- Review Cycles: 5
- Enhanced Prompt: "Explain quantum entanglement from absolute basics..."

**Result:** Detailed beginner-friendly video!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Gemini API key not configured"
- Add `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env`
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### "Failed to start video generation"
- Check Manim server is running: `curl http://localhost:5002/health`
- Verify `VITE_MANIM_API_URL` in `.env`

### Questions don't appear
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Gemini API key is valid
- Check API quota at Google AI Studio

### Video stuck in "started" status
- Normal! Generation takes 1-3 minutes
- Status updates every 5 seconds automatically
- Check Manim server logs for progress

## 🎓 Tips

### For Best Results
1. Be specific in your prompts
   - Good: "explain calculus derivatives with examples"
   - Bad: "math stuff"

2. Answer assessment questions honestly
   - AI adapts content to YOUR level
   - Don't guess - accurate assessment = better video

3. Use the queue
   - Generate multiple videos at once
   - No need to wait for one to finish
   - Come back later to view completed ones

### Advanced Usage
- **Review Cycles**: More cycles = higher quality (but slower)
  - Beginners get 4-5 cycles automatically
  - Experts get 1-2 cycles
  
- **Video Queue Persistence**: 
  - Jobs saved in localStorage
  - Can close browser and return later
  - Queue shows on all pages

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Question Generation**: 2-5 seconds
- **Assessment Analysis**: 2-4 seconds
- **Video Generation**: 60-180 seconds (1-3 minutes)
- **Total Time**: ~2-3 minutes from start to finish

## 🚀 Next Steps

After your first video is generated:

1. **View it** in the browser player
2. **Download** as MP4 file
3. **Generate more videos** on different topics
4. **Check Queue** to see all your videos

## 📝 Notes

- All videos are personalized to YOUR knowledge level
- The more you use it, the better it gets at understanding you
- Videos include clear animations using Manim
- Perfect for visual learners!
